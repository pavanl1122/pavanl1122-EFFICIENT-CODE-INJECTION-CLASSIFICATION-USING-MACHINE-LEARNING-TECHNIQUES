EFFICIENT CODE INJECTION CLASSIFICATION USING MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES
Overview
This project aims to develop an efficient code injection classification system using various machine learning techniques. The system is designed to detect and classify different types of code injections, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and command injection, to enhance the security of software applications.

# Features
Utilizes machine learning algorithms for code injection classification.
Supports detection of various types of code injections.
Provides an efficient and accurate classification mechanism.
Allows for customization and extension to different programming languages and frameworks.
# Requirements
Google colab
# Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/efficient-code-injection-classification.git
